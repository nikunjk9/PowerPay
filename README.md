## 01 Introduction
**Problem Statement**: The manual system is suffering from a series of drawbacks. Since the entire billing process is maintained manually, it becomes a tedious and lengthy process for the customer. It is time-consuming and laborious for the staff as they need to visit the customer's place every month to give the bills and receive payments. Additionally, the existing system is partially automated but still requires entering the same information at different places.
