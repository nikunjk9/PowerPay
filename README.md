# PowerPay
PowerPay is a `Desktop Application` which can serve the Electricity Department by computerizing the billing system, reducing manual efforts. Users can view, pay bills online, enhancing efficiency for both customers and administrators.

## 01 Introduction
**Problem Statement**: The manual system is suffering from a series of drawbacks. Since the entire billing process is maintained manually, it becomes a tedious and lengthy process for the customer. It is time-consuming and laborious for the staff as they need to visit the customer's place every month to give the bills and receive payments. Additionally, the existing system is partially automated but still requires entering the same information at different places.

## 02 Solution

This project system eliminates the need for maintaining paper electricity bills, as all the electricity bill records are managed electronically. The administrator doesn't have to keep a manual track of the users. The system automatically calculates fines, and users don't have to visit the office for bill payment. There is no need for a delivery boy to deliver bills to the user's place. Thus, it saves human efforts and resources.
